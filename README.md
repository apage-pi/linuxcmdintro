This is an Interactive Introduction to Linux commands. It was originally made for a school project but I
decided to post it to the internet so others could use it.

- echo
- touch
- nano
- cat
- less
- grep
- mv
- apt/dnf/yum
- pacman
- nmcli/iwctl
- mount/umount

### Running ###
There are two ways to do this:
1. Download the repository, unzip it, then run the main.py file.
2. Download the repository, unzip it, then build the docker image.
3. (Not implemented) Run the docker image onedrive365/linuxcmdintro (docker pull onedrive365/linuxcmdintro:latest && docker run onedrive365/linuxcmdintro:latest).
